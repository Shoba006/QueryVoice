# HHGOARAG

**Hindi grounded retrieval-augmented answering.** Ask a question in Hindi, get an
answer that is either supported by cited passages from a real corpus, or an
honest refusal to answer.

Runs entirely on your machine. **No API key. No hosted API. No subscription.**

---

## The problem

A retrieval system that sounds confident is easy. A retrieval system that is
*checkable* is not. Two failure modes matter more than headline accuracy:

1. **Ungrounded answers.** A language model asked a question it cannot support
   from the evidence will usually produce something plausible anyway.
2. **Misleading metrics.** Recall@10 of 0.63 means nothing if only 2% of the
   evaluation queries have their answer passage inside the indexed corpus. That
   measures the corpus, not the retriever.

HHGOARAG treats both as first-class engineering concerns. Retrieval decides what
is true; the language model only phrases it. Every claim carries a citation that
is validated against the retrieved set, and the evaluation pipeline refuses to
report metrics when its coverage cannot support them.

## Architecture

```
Hindi question
     ↓
query embedding                 multilingual-e5-small, "query: " prefix, MPS when available
     ↓
FAISS HNSW search               inner product over L2-normalised float32 vectors
     ↓
top-k Hindi passages
     ↓
evidence selection              score floor, margin, item and character budgets
     ↓                          ── weak retrieval abstains here, before any generation
local language model            Ollama (qwen2.5), temperature 0, evidence-only prompt
     ↓
citation validation             cited IDs must exist in the retrieved evidence
     ↓                          ── an answer with only invented citations is discarded
Hindi answer + evidence + confidence
```

Two properties are enforced in code, not by prompting:

- **Abstention happens before generation.** If the best retrieval score is below
  the floor, no model is called at all.
- **Citations are numbers, not hashes.** The model cites `[1]`, `[2]`; those map
  back to passage IDs here. A model asked to copy 66-character hashes will
  eventually corrupt one, and a corrupted citation cannot be told apart from an
  invented one.

### Document API

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/documents` | multipart PDF upload; returns immediately, ingestion continues in the background |
| `GET /api/documents` | all documents with status and progress |
| `GET /api/documents/{id}` | one document — poll this for progress |
| `DELETE /api/documents/{id}` | remove a document and its index |
| `GET /api/sources` | selectable knowledge sources |

`POST /api/query` takes an optional `source`: `"corpus"` or `"document:<id>"`.

```bash
curl -s -F file=@"GOA Task-2.pdf" localhost:8000/api/documents
curl -s localhost:8000/api/query -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"question":"गोवा का सबसे व्यस्त समुद्र तट कौन सा है?","source":"document:doc_3a0305a3b5035904"}'
```

## Dataset

[`ai4bharat/MSMARCO-XI`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai4bharat/MSMARCO-XI),
pinned to revision `bf5cdc1f26e581e519018e434db14edd1b77602b`. Hindi
(`hin_Deva`) train split, 778,638 records in a single 3.72 GB Parquet row group.

Ingestion reads that file with bounded memory: `pre_buffer=False` plus an
explicit `buffer_size`, which is the difference between pulling the whole 3.72 GB
into ~4 GB of RSS and pulling a few tens of MB in range requests. See
`src/data/remote_parquet.py` — the numbers are in its docstring.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <this repo> && cd hhgoarag
./run.sh
```

That single command installs dependencies, builds the corpus, evaluation set and
FAISS index if they are missing, picks demonstration questions from the real
data, and opens the application at <http://127.0.0.1:8000>.

First run takes roughly 20 minutes, unattended, and downloads about 500 MB.
Re-runs start in seconds because every stage is skipped when its artifacts exist.

### Optional: generated answers instead of quoted evidence

```bash
./run.sh --pull        # installs qwen2.5:3b-instruct (~2 GB) via Ollama
```

Without a local model the application still works end to end — it quotes the
best retrieved passage verbatim, which is never ungrounded. With one, it
synthesises a Hindi answer from the evidence and cites it. Nothing about this is
required for the demo.

Model preference order is in `src/rag/generator.py`; the strongest installed
model wins. `qwen2.5:7b-instruct` gives noticeably better Hindi if you have the
RAM for it.

## Building the data yourself

```bash
python3 scripts/preflight.py                    # verify environment and dataset access
python3 scripts/run_pipeline.py --limit 5000    # corpus → evaluation → index → benchmark
python3 scripts/project_status.py --prefix hi-train-5k
```

`run_pipeline.py` verifies between every stage and stops with a precise
recommendation if the evaluation set is too small to benchmark honestly. Each
stage is resumable: re-run the same command after an interruption.

Artifacts use a prefix (`hi-train-5k`), and every builder refuses to overwrite
artifacts it did not create, so experiments never clobber each other.

## Running the application

```bash
./run.sh --app-only              # skip building, start the server
python3 scripts/run_app.py       # equivalent, with more flags
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--prefix hi-train-15k` | serve a different corpus |
| `--generator extractive` | force evidence-only answers |
| `--device mps` | override device detection |
| `--top-k 20` | retrieve more candidates |
| `--port 8080` | bind elsewhere |

### API

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | readiness, corpus/index alignment, generator status |
| `GET /api/stats` | corpus, index, evaluation and latency figures |
| `GET /api/demo` | demonstration questions selected from real data |
| `POST /api/query` | `{"question": "..."}` → answer, citations, evidence, confidence, timings |

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/api/query -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"question":"मैनहट्टन परियोजना की सफलता का क्या प्रभाव पड़ा?"}' | python3 -m json.tool
```

The embedding model, FAISS index and passage store are loaded once at startup
and reused for every request.

## Example Hindi queries

| Question | Demonstrates |
|---|---|
| मैनहट्टन परियोजना की सफलता का तुरंत क्या प्रभाव पड़ा? | strong single-passage evidence |
| मैग्नीशियम क्या है? | definition drawn from retrieved text |
| एक सख्त उबला हुआ अंडा कितने समय तक पकाते हैं? | procedural answer with citation |
| क्या बृहस्पति ग्रह पर मानव बस्तियाँ स्थापित हो चुकी हैं? | **safe abstention** — no supporting evidence |
| मेरे बैंक खाते में कितना पैसा है? | out-of-corpus refusal |

`scripts/pick_demo_questions.py` regenerates this list from whatever corpus is
actually built, so the demo never depends on a hand-guessed example.

## Evaluation

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_evaluation.py \
  --corpus data/processed/hi-train-5k-corpus.jsonl \
  --evaluation data/processed/hi-validation-5k-evaluation.jsonl
```

Reports Recall@1/5/10, MRR, and per-stage latency at p50/p95/p100, alongside
corpus size, evaluation query count, positive coverage and query coverage.

**Coverage gates the metrics.** When query coverage falls below 95%, Recall and
MRR are labelled `INVALID (low coverage)` in every report and the pipeline
refuses to proceed. This is not decoration: an earlier build had 994 passages,
1.94% positive coverage, and a Recall@5 of 0.54 that meant nothing at all.

**Known bias, stated plainly:** the evaluation set only contains validation
queries whose gold passage is byte-identical to a passage in the train corpus.
That is a biased sample. These numbers are a pipeline health measure, not a
claim about Hindi retrieval quality in general.

## Performance

Measured, not assumed. Ingestion configuration was chosen from an instrumented
byte-counting experiment (`src/data/remote_parquet.py` docstring); `to_pydict()`
was benchmarked against `to_pylist()` and column projection before being left
alone, because it was already the fastest safe option.

- Models and indexes load once at startup, never per request.
- Passage metadata uses a byte-offset index rather than an in-RAM dict:
  ~1 GB → ~160 MB at a million passages, at 0.09 ms per lookup.
- Index construction streams the corpus, checkpoints, and resumes.
- Apple Silicon MPS is detected and used automatically for embedding.

## Limitations

- Hindi only. The loader supports 13 languages; nothing else has been evaluated.
- Dense retrieval only — no BM25, fusion or reranking. Those were deliberately
  deferred until the dense baseline was measurable.
- The evaluation sample is biased as described above.
- The corpus covers a slice of the 778,638 available Hindi train records.
- Speech is the browser's own recognition, so voice input needs Chrome, Edge or
  Safari; there is a typed fallback everywhere.
- Scanned PDFs are refused rather than OCR'd. Adding OCR would mean a Tesseract
  dependency, and refusing clearly beats guessing badly.

## Task requirements

This build targets HH Goa 2026 Task 2. Each requirement is mapped to its
implementation and a verification command in
[`docs/TASK_COMPLIANCE.md`](docs/TASK_COMPLIANCE.md) — speech-to-text via Sarvam,
six comparable chunking strategies with a benchmark, P50/P70/P100 latency
analytics, the staged harness, and the three guardrail layers.

## Release audit

```bash
python3 scripts/release_audit.py
```

Runs the whole test suite, verifies corpus/index alignment, loads the real
service, measures startup and per-stage latency, exercises the corpus flow, the
abstention path, PDF ingestion with page citation, restart persistence and
determinism, checks that no hosted-LLM reference exists in shipped code, and
verifies each demonstration question behaves as labelled. It writes
`docs/RELEASE_AUDIT.md` with every measured number and exits non-zero if any
check fails. Checks it cannot run are recorded as SKIP with the reason, never
as PASS.

## Judge demonstration

The full five-minute sequence is in [`docs/JUDGE_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/JUDGE_CHECKLIST.md).

```bash
./run.sh
```

Then, in the browser:

1. Click **मैनहट्टन परियोजना…** — a grounded answer with a cited passage and a
   high-confidence badge.
2. Expand **All retrieved passages** — every candidate with its similarity score.
3. Click the **बृहस्पति ग्रह** question — the system declines, states why, and
   shows the best score it found. Nothing is invented.
4. **Upload a PDF** (`tests/fixtures/goa-task-2-sample.pdf` works, or any of your
   own). Watch it move through the ingestion stages to **ready**.
5. Pick it in **Knowledge source**, click the **microphone**, and ask in Hindi:
   *"गोवा का सबसे व्यस्त समुद्र तट कौन सा है?"* The recognised Hindi appears in the
   box, the answer comes back grounded, and **Sources** reads
   **GOA Task-2.pdf — Page 7**.
6. Ask the same PDF something it cannot support — the system abstains.

No API key is entered at any point. Disconnect from the network after startup
and every one of these still works.
